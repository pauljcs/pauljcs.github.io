Hey! I'm Paul and I (*try to*) do science.

I'm currently doing my PhD in cognitive neuroscience at the University of MÃ¼nster in Germany under the supervision of [Niko Busch](https://www.uni-muenster.de/PsyIFP/AEBusch/Mitarbeiter/busch.shtml). My work focusses on the influence and interactions of different biological oscillations - especially brain, eye and breathing - with visual memory. I try to understand how differences in brain states impact subsequent processing. I also love to geek out and learn more about methods. When I'm not sitting at the desk or in the lab I teach classes about decision making and EEG methodology.
